## Welcome to my profile!

I am 32 years old, identify as a woman and am originally from a small town near Hamburg.  
I grew up on a horse farm in the beautyful green countryside of Elmenhorst.

## What I like doing in my free time
My favourite thing in the **world** is traveling with *my husband Jimmy and my dog Elli*.  
We have been to 18 countries and many more should follow.  

This is Elli on holiday!
