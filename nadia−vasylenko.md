## Smll Intro
My name is Nadia Vasylenko.  
I was born in _Ukraine_.  
I live in **Germany** for almost a year. 

This is my favorite quote:  
> Be yourself. Everyone else is already taken.  

**_Oscar Wilde_**  

That is why I really appreciate to be with my friends. I feel comfortable around them.  
We also share same hobbies. Our favorite is cooking together. We like to meet during the week and try new recepies.  
So our top 3 are:
1. Avocado toasts
2. Honey chicken 
3. Banana bread  


For honey chicken you only need 4 ingredients:
- [ ] Honey
- [ ] Chicken
- [ ] Soy sauce 
- [ ] Garlic
